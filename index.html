        <h1>Super Simple Parallax Fullscreen Hero Header with Object-Fit</h1>
      
        <a class="anchor" id="what"></a>
      
        <h2>What does “parallax” mean?</h2>
      
        <p>The in some corners of the web still popular “parallax effect” means that an object, in most cases an image, moves in a different speed than the default scroll speed. In other words, yes, it usually makes no sense whatsoever. Just eye candy.</p>
        <p>And to make this example even more eye candier I use two congruent images, split in background and foreground, with different speeds.</p>
      
        <a class="anchor" id="why"></a>
      
        <h2>Why is this solution different?</h2>
      
        <p>Most parallax solutions work with background images, which is totally fine. When they gave us <em>background-size: cover</em> back in the day it became even more flexible to make the idea work in a responsive environment.</p>
        <p>However, you probably want an <em>&lt;img&gt;</em> in your html so that you can use <em>&lt;source&gt; / &lt;srcset&gt;</em>, have an alt text and easily control everything with the CMS of your choice.</p>
        <p>The concept is super simple, as the title promised. We absolute position a <em>div</em> in a (in this case fullscreen) container and only manipulate the <em>top</em> and <em>bottom</em> values in relation to the window scroll position, so it's really just a few lines of (jQuery) code.</p>
      
        <p>Since <em>object-fit: cover</em> lets the image fill the <em>div</em> and the overflow is hidden you won't see gaps.</p>
      
        <a class="anchor" id="align"></a>
      
        <h2>Aligning the image(s)</h2>
      
        <p>This solution is of course naturally responsive. But depending on the image you may want to determine the focus, especially for small screens. Similar to <em>background-position</em> we thankfully have <em>object-position</em>. So I've added classes for that.</p>
      
        <a class="anchor" id="extend"></a>
      
        <h2>Extending the idea</h2>
      
        <p>There are of course countless possibilities. You could easily add more layers – maybe for text. I've already included the option to darken the image(s). But keep an eye on the performance. Use <em>&lt;srcset&gt;</em> to serve the perfect image sizes for all screens.</p>
        <p>Btw, the container doesn't need to be fullscreen, it just needs some height and the images will align.</p>
